# Saraswati Puja Website for College Event

This repository contains a simple website built for demonstrating the **Saraswati Puja** celebration at our college. The website is designed to provide information about the event, its significance, and the schedule of the puja. It showcases a clean, user-friendly interface with all necessary details for students and faculty to stay informed.

## Project Overview:

The website consists of two main files:
1. **index.html** - The main landing page of the website, displaying event details and introductory information about Saraswati Puja.
2. **server.html** - A server page that provides further details about the event schedule, location, and any updates about the puja.

These files represent the basic structure of a simple website designed for the Saraswati Puja event at our college. The project aims to showcase HTML and CSS skills for event-based web design.

## Files in the Project:

- **index.html**:
  - Contains the introductory section of the website, including a header, event information, and a brief description of Saraswati Puja.
